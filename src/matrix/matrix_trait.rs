/// Trait defining a generic matrix type.
///
/// # Note
///
/// In addition to the methods defined by this trait, this trait also forces that the implementor
/// also support indexing ([`Index`]) and mutable indexing ([`IndexMut`]) by a 2-element tuple of
/// [`usize`]s (1st element defining the row index, 2nd element defining the column index).
///
/// # Using [`Matrix`] as a trait bound
///
/// Say I want to write a function that is generic over all matrices of [`f64`], e.g. I want it to
/// be compatible both with [`ndarray::Array2<f64>`] and with [`nalgebra::DVector<f64>`]. I can
/// define this function as
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn my_function<M: Matrix<f64>>(input_vector: &M) -> M { ... }
/// ```
///
/// Since the [`Matrix`] trait is generic over types that implement the [`Scalar`] trait, any
/// function that is generic over [`Matrix`]es can also be made generic over the type of their
/// elements. In this case, if we want `my_function` to be compatible with vectors of any scalar
/// type (i.e. types that implement the [`Scalar`] trait), and not just vectors of [`f64`]s, we can
/// include an additional generic parameter `S`.
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn my_function<S: Scalar, V: Vector<S>>(input_vector: &V) -> V { ... }
/// ```
///
/// ## Warning
///
/// When working with arrays from [`ndarray`], elements of the array must also implement the
/// following traits in addition to the [`Scalar`] trait:
///
/// * [`ndarray::ScalarOperand`]
/// * [`ndarray::LinalgScalar`]
///
/// For example, consider the case where we define the struct `CustomType` and implement the
/// [`Scalar`] trait for `CustomType`. If we want to be able to pass an
/// [`ndarray::Array2<CustomType>`] into `my_function` from the example above, then we must also
/// implement the [`ndarray::ScalarOperand`] and [`ndarray::LinalgScalar`] traits for `CustomType`.

/// # Interoperability with [`f64`]s.
///
/// We enforce that scalar types be interoperable with [`f64`]s. Some common differentiation
/// methods, notably forward-mode automatic differentation and complex-step differentiation, rely
/// on replacing real numbers with a custom type of number that has its own arithmetic (dual numbers
/// for forward-mode automatic differentiation, complex numbers for complex-step differentiation).
/// Forcing scalars to have this interoperability with [`f64`]s built-in helps enable downstream
/// crates to write functions in way that can be used with both plain [`f64`]s for most use cases,
/// and with custom types when the functions need to be differentiated.
///
/// Additionally, we chose to restrict this interoperability to be with [`f64`]s since
/// double-precision floating point numbers are the de facto standard for numerical computations.
///
/// # Note
///
/// [`nalgebra::Complex`] does not satisfy the the [`Scalar`] trait because it does not implement
/// the [`PartialOrd`] trait.

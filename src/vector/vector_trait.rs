/// Trait defining common vector methods and operations.
///
/// # Note
///
/// In addition to the methods defined by this trait, this trait also forces that the implementor
/// also support indexing ([`Index`]) and mutable indexing ([`IndexMut`]).
/// 
/// # Using [`Vector`] as a trait bound
/// 
/// Say I want to write a function that is generic over all vectors of [`f64`], e.g. I want it to be
/// compatible both with [`Vec<f64>`] and with [`nalgebra::Vector1<f64>`]. I can define this
/// function as
/// 
/// ```ignore
/// fn my_function<V: Vector<f64>>(input_vector: &V) -> V { ... }
/// ```
/// 
/// Since the [`Vector`] trait is generic over types that implement the [`Scalar`] trait, any
/// function that is generic over [`Vector`]s can also be made generic over the type of their
/// elements. In this case, if we want `my_function` to be  compatible with vectors of any scalar
/// type (i.e. types that implement the [`Scalar`] trait), and not just vectors of [`f64`]s, we can
/// include an additional generic parameter `S`.
/// 
/// ```ignore
/// fn my_function<S: Scalar, V: Vector<S>>(input_vector: &V) -> V { ... }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Warning
///
/// When working with arrays from [`ndarray`], elements of the array must also implement the
/// following traits in addition to the [`Scalar`] trait:
/// 
/// * [`ndarray::ScalarOperand`]
/// * [`ndarray::LinalgScalar`]
/// 
/// For example, consider the case where we define the struct `CustomType` and implement the 
/// [`Scalar`] trait for `CustomType`. If we want to be able to pass a
/// [`ndarray::Array1<CustomType>`] into `my_function` from the example above, then we must also
/// implement the [`ndarray::ScalarOperand`] and [`ndarray::LinalgScalar`] traits for `CustomType`.

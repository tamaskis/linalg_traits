# Introduction

The primary purpose of the `linalg-traits` crate is to provide the tools to write generic linear algebra. In particular, the traits provided by `linalg-traits` are extremely useful for writing functions that are generic over scalars, vectors, and matrices.

For example, consider a function that multiplies a matrix by a vector. Using an `TODO`

TODO:
* statically sized vs. dynamically sized
* types of functions
    * univariate, scalar-valued
    * univariate, vector-valued
    * multivariate, scalar-valued
    * multivariate, vector-valued

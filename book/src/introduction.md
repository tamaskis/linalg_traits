# Introduction

The primary purpose of the `linalg-traits` crate is to provide the tools to write generic linear algebra. In particular, the traits provided by `linalg-traits` are extremely useful for writing functions that are generic over scalars, vectors, and matrices.

For example, consider a function that multiplies a matrix by a vector. Using an ``
